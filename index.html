          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 1578</strong></span> - Okuni is born in small village within the province of Izumo.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 1584</strong></span> - Okuni is abducted by village priests and forced to become a shrine maiden for the Izumo shrine, undergoing torturous and harsh training. </li>
          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 1591</strong></span> - Okuni's close shrine maiden friend Ohana unseals an evil god, causing it to rampage and slaughter her entire village. Okuni was left as the only survivor, and as a result, makes it her life goal to seal the wicked god.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 1603</strong></span> - During her travels, Okuni forms an all-female trouple and founds <span class="italic">kabuki-odori, later referred to as Okuni kabuki. She used her dances as funding and a mask to hide her true purpose.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 1610</strong></span> - Okuni retires after her performances become seen as "immoral" and continues traveling alone with her puppet Zanzaburo. According to legend, Okuni may have had a partner named Nagoya Sansaburo of which the puppet is based on. In reality, Zanzaburo is the vessel for the shrine god of Izumo.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 1618</strong></span> - Okuni passes away in her 30s and enters the Throne of Heroes as a heroic spirit, having never accomplished her true goal.</li>
          <li><strong><span class="date">~ 2021</strong></span> - Okuni is summoned by Chaldea after the events of <span class="italic">"Shōwa Kishin Project GUDAGUDA Ryōma's Close Call! The Mystery of the Vanished Nobu"</span>, during which she managed to seal away the god at last. She remains an active heroic spirit, continuing to enjoy adventures and seeking new discoveries.</li>
